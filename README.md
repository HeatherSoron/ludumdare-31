## Super Color-o RGB: Legend of the Several Stars

You, Color-o, live in a world composed of 3 planes (or "colors") of existence: the Red, the Green, and the Blue.

Most things in this world can only interact with their own color. However, you have the special ability to shift between different colors. You have also heard of the mystical Several Stars, objects of power that belong - somehow! - to two separate colors at once.

Just beware of the terrifying Black, which can absorb power from any color!


## Playing the game

This is an entry for Ludum Dare #31. If you came here from the LD website, you've probably already got a link to a web version.

To play the game offline, place all the game files onto a local filesystem, and then open up "index.html" in a web browser.

Chrome or Firefox are recommended. Safari has an annoying auido lag issue, and Internet Explorer is, well, Internet Explorer.
