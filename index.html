				You, Color-o, live in a world composed of 3 planes (or "colors") of existence: the <span class="red">Red</span>, the <span class="green">Green</span>, and the <span class="blue">Blue</span>.<br/>
				Most things in this world can only interact with their own color. However, you have the special ability to shift between different colors. You have also heard of the mystical Several Stars, objects of power that belong - somehow! - to <i>two</i> separate colors at once.<br/>
				Just beware of the terrifying Black, which can absorb power from any color!
			</p>
			<p>
				Placing platforms takes 10 power each.<br/>
				Attacking takes 0.5 power each time.<br/>
				Super attacks take 5 power, but are black.<br/>
				Only normal attacks can be used when power is low.<br/>
				Killing an enemy gives 10 power of each OTHER color.<br/>
			</p>

				Controls:
				<ul>
					<li><span class="ctrl">left/right</span> (arrow keys) to move</li>
					<li><span class="ctrl">space</span> to jump</li>
					<li><span class="red ctrl">1, Z</span>, <span class="green ctrl">2, X</span>, <span class="blue ctrl">3, C</span>, or up/down to shift color</li>
					<li><span class="red ctrl">Q</span>, <span class="green ctrl">W</span>, <span class="blue ctrl">E</span> to place colored platforms</li>
					<li><span class="red ctrl">A</span>, <span class="green ctrl">S</span>, <span class="blue ctrl">D</span> for a power ball (attack)</li>

				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Tips:
				<ul id="tips">
					<li id="first-tip">Kill ALL the enemies - killing enemies refills your power bars</li>
					<li>When your current color's power is low, you're vulnerable! Switch to a color where you have lots of power, instead.</li>
					<li>Picking up the Several Stars will increase your maximum power</li>
				</ul>
